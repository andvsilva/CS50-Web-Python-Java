# [CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)

In this course, we are picking up where CS50 left off and diving into the design and creation of web applications. We will build our web-design skills by working on a number of projects throughout the course, including an open-ended final project where you will have the chance to create a website of your own!
